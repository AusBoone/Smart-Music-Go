# Smart-Music-Go

- cmd/web/: This is where the application is initialized and the server is started. The main.go file will reside here.
- pkg/handlers/: This package will contain the HTTP handlers that respond to web requests.
- pkg/spotify/: This package will contain the code to interact with the Spotify API.
- ui/static/ and ui/templates/: These directories will contain the static files (CSS, JavaScript) and HTML templates for your application.
- go.mod and go.sum: These files are used by Go's module system.


For this, we'll need to install a Go client for the Spotify Web API. One such client is zmb3/spotify. 
You can install it by running go get github.com/zmb3/spotify in your terminal.



Deployment: Finally, once the application is ready,  deploy it to a server. Use a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
